1. Link Generation (LLM-Assisted)
Tool: OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (via OpenAI Playground, or free alternatives like HuggingFace Transformers in Python).
Generate search queries and extract potential URLs based on topics/keywords.
Implementation: Set up a script that formulates queries, uses an API like SerpAPI (has a free tier), or does direct Google/Bing searches using libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup.

2. Human-in-the-Loop Link Verification
Tool: A minimal Flask or Streamlit web app for humans to review generated links.
Implementation: Display candidate links and use simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down approval. Store results for further processing.

3. Store Links in Database
Recommended DB: For rapid prototyping and ease of use, use SQLite (SQL) or MongoDB Atlas (free tier, NoSQL).
Implementation: Set up schemas to store link, approval status, topic/keywords.

Later Stage Features:
4. User Input and Keyword Selection
Tool: Extend your web interface to receive user keywords or queries.
Implementation: Build simple input forms. Use LLM for keyword expansion or synonym suggestion.

5. Select Relevant Links Using ML
Tool: Scikit-learn for classic ML; Consider simple vector space models (TF-IDF) or basic BERT embeddings (via HuggingFace) for semantic matching.
Implementation: Organize links by relevance score given an input query.

6. Web Scraping
Tool: Use Python’s requests and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. Selenium (optional) for dynamic content (free, but heavier).
Implementation: Scrape selected links, extract desired text/data fields.

7. Data Organising and NLP
Tool: Pandas for structuring, spaCy or NLTK for NLP processing (entity recognition, sentiment, summarization).
Implementation: Organize scraped content into tables, preprocess/filter using NLP for downstream analysis/output.

8. Output to User
Tool: Keep output simple: display on web app; optionally export as CSV/Excel via Pandas.
Implementation: Allow users to browse, search, and download results easily.

9. User Feedback Integration
Tool: Add feedback forms/buttons. Store feedback in DB.
Implementation: Use feedback to retrain ranking algorithms or adjust link-generation prompts.

System Improvement Workflow
Collect feedback after every user interaction.
Regularly fine-tune link relevance models and LLM link-generation prompts based on feedback.
Maintain an automated and manual review loop.
